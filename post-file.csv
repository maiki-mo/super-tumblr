1,The Soul,Astral Metempsychosis,"Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.",11,11
2,Discipline,Divine Revolutions,"The strongest affection and utmost zeal should, I think, promote the studies concerned with the most beautiful objects. This is the discipline that deals with the universe's divine revolutions, the stars' motions, sizes, distances, risings and settings . . . for what is more beautiful than heaven?",1,1
3,Spots,The Vastness,Do not look at stars as bright spots only. Try to take in the vastness of the universe.,2,2

6,The Call,Five Senses,"Equipped with his five senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure Science.",10,10
7,Too Intelligent,The Universe,I'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.,9,9
8,The Cosmos,Feeblest Contemplations,"The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us—there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, or falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.",7,7
9,The Cosmos II,Was or Ever Will Be,"If it’s a new planet, sign me up. I’m tired of driving around the block, boldly going where hundreds have gone before in orbit around earth--give me a place to go and I’ll go.",6,6
10,The Confine,Terrestrial Matters,To confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit.,5,5
11,Grasp,Far Better,"It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.",7,7
12,Can Bind,Reconcile,"If there is anything that can bind the heavenly mind of man to this dreary exile of our earthly home and can reconcile us with our fate so that one can enjoy living, then it is verily the enjoyment of the mathematical sciences and astronomy.",11,11

15,Tiny Pea,Very Small,"It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.",12,12
16,Indifferent,Not Benign Nor Hostile,"The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent.",7,7
17,No Where,How the Heavens Go,"The Bible tells us how to go to Heaven, not how the heavens go.",13,13

19,Never Lie,Ahem,"The stars never lie, but the astrologers lie about the stars.",14,14
20,The Knowledge,Light Elements,"The knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth - the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars- the high mass ones among them- went unstable in their later years- they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems- stars with orbiting planets. And those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up- many people feel small, cause their small and the universe is big. But I feel big because my atoms came from those stars.",6,6
